# Polypeptide-Printer

## Function of this program
This program, when given a sequence of Human DNA (must be human DNA as the codons in the program only account for the 20 Amino Acids found in the human body)
will print out a Polypeptide Chain of all the amino acids connected together. It sends this output to a file called "PolypeptideChain.txt".

## Sample Output
When provided with the sequence: "ATTGGTTATACTTGTTCTATT"
Polypeptide-Printer will print rougly the following output:
Formatted DNA sequence to be parsed: ATTGGTTATACTTGTTCTATT

ISOLEUCINE

GLYCINE

   |
   
TYROSINE

   |
   
THREONINE

   |
   
CYSTEINE

   |
   
SERINE

ISOLEUCINE

## NOTE
It's important to keep in mind that because this program doesn't account for all codons, the default amino acid print out will be "NOT ESSENTIAL".
